Here I will explore implementations of an NCO in something which isn't dictated by a reliable Clock

Main Concerns:
    -Timing, how reliable am I able to make a sine wave? e.g. sine, do stuff, return to sine, repeat.
        - In uC there's systick
        - IRL????
    -Calculating sine
        - math.sine()
        - Taylor Series
        - LUT
    
How Can I actually validate my findings?
-Output clock.monotnic?

kek let's start at the arduino level I guess.
